# P0: Experiment Data

I used the scatterplot example as the basis of my main.js and scatterplot.js from:
https://codesandbox.io/s/github/UBC-InfoVis/2021-436V-examples/tree/master/d3-static-scatter-plot

In main.js, I changed the values to match the dataset for this project. In scatterplot.js, I edited the axes, scaling,
formatting, labels, and introduced new labels to match the desired result image. I also made the axes dynamic to account
for varying numbers of trials and any range of accuracy values.
