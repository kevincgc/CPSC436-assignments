Resources used:

**Tutorial scatterplot example:**

I used the html-based legend from here. I changed the markers to circles and I split the selections into two columns.

**D3 Case Study: The Impact of Vaccines on the Measles:**

I used this to help me make the hovering tooltip by modifying the mouseover function. I also used it to help me draw
the marks, since the horizontally lined cells were similar in layout to the semicircles in the assignment.

**D3 Case Study: Drought and Deluge in the Lower 48:**
https://github.com/UBC-InfoVis/436V-materials/tree/22Jan/case-studies/case-study_drought
I used this to help understand how to show the dynamic labels and how to format my top axis.
