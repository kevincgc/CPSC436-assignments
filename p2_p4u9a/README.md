# P2: Visualizing Political Leaders

Note: When there are ambiguities between the demo video and the spec, I followed the demo video.  
Tamara notes on piazza that "Clarification: ideally follow the video, but since the spec did not match that, we will give full credit for either choice."

Resources used:

**Tutorial advanced interactivity example with barchart and scatterplot:**  
https://githubbox.com/UBC-InfoVis/2021-436V-examples/tree/master/d3-linked-charts-basic  
I used this as the basis for my bar chart and scatterplot classes. I also used it to learn how to apply interactions
between different charts through main.js.

**P1:**  
I used my P1 code to apply the clip mask to the lexis chart, to help me create the mouseover tooltip popups, and as 
a reference on how to handle interactions with the HTML dropdown menu.

I used css styles from P0 and P1.
