# P2: Visualizing Political Leaders

Resources used:

**Tutorial advanced interactivity example with barchart and scatterplot:**  
https://githubbox.com/UBC-InfoVis/2021-436V-examples/tree/master/d3-linked-charts-basic  
I used this as the basis for my bar chart and scatterplot classes. I also used it to learn how to apply interactions
between different charts through main.js.

**P1:**  
I used my P1 code to apply the clip mask to the lexis chart, to help me create the mouseover tooltip popups, and as 
a reference on how to handle interactions with the HTML dropdown menu.

I used css styles from P0 and P1.
